# myGitFolio
Gather all your GitHub repositories, and a small descripton of them into one file, and then send it off.
**Note:**    
You must use gitfolio from the module (folder) gitfolio.    
Otherwise there will be errors. Basically, your file must be    
one directory up from the gitfolio module, and the you:    
```Python
from gitfolio import builder
```
to import all the functions.
